# Kuro's Devlog
Here is the devlog for the warnings that were previously shown on the main page

## 18/01/2022

Since both of Ao's repos are no longer maintained (both by [pythonRelay](https://github.com/pythonInRelay/ao) & the [original](https://github.com/klaussinani/ao)). I decided to fork the latest working version of Ao and rebrand it into something that can actually be pushed the app stores in the Linux ecosystems.

I've fixed a few visual bugs and am working on a re-brand of Ao into Kuro. I'll change the logo and some more stuff inside the app.
## 26/01/2022
Released the first working version of Kuro (8.0.0). This was tested on Ubuntu 21.04 and seems to be working as expected.
Please provide feedback on the [issues](https://github.com/davidsmorais/kuro/issues) page 🚀


## 21/03/2022
I think most theme issues are closed and have just released a version which also fixes the auto updater. Please download 8.0.4a.

I'm thinking  about adding new themes to make Kuro even more customizable.
I'm thinking about removing the "Sepia" theme, but would like to have some insights on its usage before doing so.
